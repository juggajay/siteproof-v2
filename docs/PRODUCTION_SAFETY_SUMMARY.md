# Production Safety Architecture - Executive Summary

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Project**: SiteProof v2 Design System Overhaul
**Objective**: Zero-downtime migration with comprehensive safety measures

---

## What We've Built

A **production-grade, bulletproof deployment strategy** for migrating SiteProof v2 to a new design system with zero downtime and maximum safety.

---

## Key Components

### 1. Feature Flag Architecture ✅

**Technology**: Flagsmith (self-hosted) + environment variable fallback

**What it enables**:
- Instant rollback without deployment (< 60 seconds)
- Gradual user rollout (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- Component-level control (rollback just navigation, just forms, etc.)
- A/B testing capabilities
- User segment targeting (beta users, power users, etc.)

**Implementation**:
- Provider pattern with React Context
- Component-level feature flag wrappers
- Automatic fallback to environment variables
- Real-time flag updates

### 2. Comprehensive Testing Strategy ✅

**Coverage**:
- **E2E Tests** (Playwright): All critical user paths
- **Visual Regression** (Percy): Catch UI breaks automatically
- **Accessibility** (jest-axe, axe-core): WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance** (Lighthouse CI): Core Web Vitals monitoring
- **Load Testing**: Ensure scale readiness

**Critical Paths Covered**:
- Authentication (login, logout, password reset)
- Dashboard (load, widgets, interactions)
- ITP Forms (submission, offline mode, photo upload)
- NCR Workflow (create, assign, status changes)
- Daily Diary (create, export PDF/Excel)

### 3. Instant Rollback Mechanisms ✅

**Primary Method**: Feature Flag Toggle
- **Speed**: < 60 seconds
- **Impact**: Immediate reversion for all users
- **Process**: Single API call or dashboard toggle

**Secondary Method**: Component-Level Rollback
- **Speed**: < 5 minutes
- **Impact**: Targeted fix for specific components
- **Process**: Disable individual feature flags

**Tertiary Method**: Full Code Revert
- **Speed**: < 30 minutes
- **Impact**: Complete reversion to V1
- **Process**: Git revert + deployment

**Emergency Script**: `./scripts/emergency-rollback.sh`
- Automated rollback execution
- Team notification via Slack
- Comprehensive logging
- Verification steps

### 4. Production Monitoring ✅

**Error Tracking** (Sentry):
- Real-time error capture
- Release tracking
- Source map support
- Session replay for debugging
- Automatic error grouping
- Alert thresholds configured

**Performance Monitoring** (Vercel Analytics + Web Vitals):
- Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Page load performance
- API response times

- Geographic performance data

**User Behavior Analytics** (PostHog):
- Feature usage tracking
- User session recording (10% sample)
- Funnel analysis
- A/B test results
- Component render tracking
- User feedback collection

**Component-Level Tracking**:
- Render performance monitoring
- Error boundary integration
- Automatic rollback on critical errors

### 5. Data Migration Safety ✅

**User Settings Preservation**:
- Automatic backup to IndexedDB before migration
- Theme preferences (light/dark/system)
- Dashboard layout and widget positions
- Custom filters and saved views
- Date/time format preferences

**Form State Protection**:
- Offline form drafts preserved
- Sync queue maintained
- Photo attachments backed up
- Automatic restoration on rollback

**Dashboard Configuration**:
- Widget positions and visibility
- Custom layouts
- Column preferences
- Sorting and filtering state

**Rollback Data Restoration**:

## Questions & Answers

### Q: What if Flagsmith goes down?
**A**: Feature flags automatically fall back to environment variables. Application continues working with last known flag state.

### Q: How long does rollback take?
**A**:
- Feature flag toggle: < 60 seconds
- Emergency script: < 5 minutes
- Full code revert: < 30 minutes

### Q: Will users lose data during rollback?
**A**: No. All user data is automatically backed up before migration. Rollback restores previous state seamlessly.

**A**:
1. Assess severity (P0-P3)
2. If critical: Instant rollback via feature flags
3. If minor: Fix forward in next deployment
4. All procedures documented in runbooks

### Q: How do we know if users like the new design?
**A**:
- In-app surveys (NPS, CSAT)
- PostHog behavior analysis
- Support ticket tracking
- Direct feedback widget
- A/B test results

### Q: What's the cost of this implementation?
**A**:
- One-time: ~160 hours of engineering time
