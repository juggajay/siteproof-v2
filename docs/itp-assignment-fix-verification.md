# ITP Assignment Fix Verification Report

**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Test Type:** Bug Fix Verification
**Tester:** Automated QA Agent
**Status:** PASSED

---

## Bug Description

### Original Issue

When attempting to assign an ITP template that was previously soft-deleted (deleted_at IS NOT NULL), the system would incorrectly report a duplicate error, preventing the assignment even though the previous instance was deleted.

### Root Cause

The duplicate detection query in `/apps/web/src/app/api/itp/instances/assign/route.ts` (line 99) was checking for existing ITP instances but **did not exclude soft-deleted records**. This caused the system to find the soft-deleted instance and incorrectly report it as a duplicate.

---

## Fix Applied

### File Modified

`/apps/web/src/app/api/itp/instances/assign/route.ts`

### Change Made (Line 99)

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect - includes soft-deleted records)
.eq('lot_id', lotId)

// AFTER (correct - excludes soft-deleted records)
.eq('lot_id', lotId)
.is('deleted_at', null)
```

### Fix Description

Added `.is('deleted_at', null)` filter to the duplicate detection query to ensure that only active (non-deleted) ITP instances are considered when checking for duplicates.

   - "Concrete Placement" appeared in ITP list

6. **Refresh page to verify persistence** - PASS
   - Page reloaded successfully
   - Both ITPs remained visible:
     - Concrete Placement
     - Concrete Preplace

## Test Results

### Network Request Analysis

#### 1. Assignment Request (POST)

```
URL: http://localhost:3000/api/itp/instances/assign
Method: POST
Status: 200 (Success)
Response: Assignment created successfully
```

**Key Response Headers:**

- `content-type: application/json`
- `x-ratelimit-limit: 60`
- `x-ratelimit-remaining: 59`

#### 2. Refetch Request (GET)

```
URL: http://localhost:3000/api/projects/8b934c17-956c-4a67-882e-d97b6bf39fe9/lots/c2637f59-88e0-4a8f-b418-3d15d7dbb30f/itp
Method: GET
Status: 200 (Success)
Response: Retrieved updated ITP list with new assignment
```

### Console Log Analysis

**ITP Data Received Log:**
The console logs confirmed that the new "Concrete Placement" instance was successfully created:

```json
{
  "id": "7f94523b-1b89-4c29-b9da-f563f09d95ce",
  "template_id": "5f075227-6b36-4da0-b882-6e38e35e5f1f",
  "project_id": "8b934c17-956c-4a67-882e-d97b6bf39fe9",
  "lot_id": "c2637f59-88e0-4a8f-b418-3d15d7dbb30f",
  "created_at": "2025-10-10T10:19:21.721075+00:00",
  "deleted_at": null,
  "itp_templates": {
    "name": "Concrete Placement",
    "description": "Inspection checklist for concrete placement"
  }
}
```

**Key Observations:**

- `deleted_at: null` confirms this is an active instance
- `created_at: "2025-10-10T10:19:21.721075+00:00"` shows successful creation
- Template details properly linked

### Visual Verification

#### Screenshots Captured:

1. **Before Assignment:** `/home/jayso/projects/siteproof-v2/docs/screenshots/itp-before-assignment.png`
   - Shows initial state with only "Concrete Preplace" ITP

2. **Modal Before Selection:** `/home/jayso/projects/siteproof-v2/docs/screenshots/itp-modal-before-selection.png`
   - Shows template selection modal with available templates

3. **After Assignment:** `/home/jayso/projects/siteproof-v2/docs/screenshots/itp-after-assignment.png`
   - Shows both "Concrete Placement" and "Concrete Preplace" ITPs

4. **After Refresh:** `/home/jayso/projects/siteproof-v2/docs/screenshots/itp-after-refresh.png`
   - Confirms persistence - both ITPs still visible after page reload

## Edge Case Verification

### Tested Scenarios:

1. Assigning a template that was previously soft-deleted - PASS
2. Multiple ITP instances on same lot - PASS
3. Data persistence across page refreshes - PASS
4. Proper refetching after mutation - PASS

### Not Tested (Out of Scope):

- Hard deletion scenarios
- Concurrent assignment attempts
- Network failure handling
- Rate limiting behavior

---

## Performance Observations

1. **Assignment Speed:** The assignment completed within ~1-2 seconds
2. **UI Responsiveness:** Modal remained responsive during assignment
3. **Refetch Timing:** The GET request was triggered immediately after POST success
4. **Rendering:** New ITP appeared in the list without page refresh

---

## Regression Testing

### Areas Verified:

- Existing ITP ("Concrete Preplace") remained unaffected
- Template selection modal still functions correctly
- Delete functionality still available for both ITPs
- Toggle functionality for expanding/collapsing ITPs

### No Regressions Detected

---

## Conclusion

### Test Result: PASSED

The bug fix successfully resolves the duplicate detection issue. The `.is('deleted_at', null)` filter ensures that:

1. Soft-deleted ITP instances are properly excluded from duplicate checks
2. Users can re-assign templates that were previously deleted
3. The system correctly identifies only active instances as duplicates
4. Data integrity is maintained throughout the assignment process

### Recommendations:

1. Add unit tests for the duplicate detection logic
2. Consider adding E2E tests for ITP assignment workflow
3. Document the soft-delete behavior in API documentation
4. Monitor for similar issues in other API endpoints

### Sign-Off:

- Fix Applied: Yes
- Testing Completed: Yes
- Production Ready: Yes
