-- Projects & Lots Query Optimization
-- Migration: 0024
-- Created: 2025-10-09
-- Purpose: Optimize projects list and lots loading queries

-- ============================================================================
-- Projects Table Optimizations
-- ============================================================================

-- Composite index for organization + status + created_at with deleted filter
-- Used in: /api/projects (main projects list query)
-- Enables fast filtering by org, status, and sorting by created_at
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_projects_org_status_created
  ON projects(organization_id, status, created_at DESC)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Composite index for organization + deleted_at
-- Used in: /api/projects (filtering deleted projects)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_projects_org_deleted
  ON projects(organization_id, deleted_at)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- ============================================================================
-- Lots Table Optimizations
-- ============================================================================

-- Composite index for project_id + lot_number with deleted filter
-- Used in: /api/projects/[projectId]/lots (lots list query)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_lots_project_deleted
  ON lots(project_id, lot_number)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- ============================================================================
-- ITP Instances for Lots Join
-- ============================================================================

-- Covering index for lot_id + inspection_status with commonly queried fields
-- Used in: /api/projects/[projectId]/lots (JOIN to fetch ITP instances)
-- INCLUDE clause allows index-only scans
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_itp_instances_lot_status
  ON itp_instances(lot_id, inspection_status)
  INCLUDE (completion_percentage)
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- ============================================================================
-- Organization Members Optimization
-- ============================================================================

-- Composite index for user_id + organization_id + role
-- Used in: /api/projects (membership lookups)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_org_members_user
  ON organization_members(user_id, organization_id, role);
