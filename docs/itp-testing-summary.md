   - Correct status codes

### 🐛 Bugs Found & Fixed

#### Bug #1: Soft-Delete Duplicate Detection ✅ FIXED

**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Users couldn't re-assign previously deleted ITP templates

**Description:**
The duplicate detection logic in the ITP assignment API was checking for existing instances but not excluding soft-deleted records (where `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`). This caused the system to incorrectly report duplicate errors when users tried to assign a template that was previously deleted.

**Fix:**

```typescript
// File: apps/web/src/app/api/itp/instances/assign/route.ts
// Line 99: Added filter to exclude soft-deleted instances

.is('deleted_at', null)  // ← Added this line
```

**Verification:**

- ✅ Template assignment succeeds without duplicate errors
- ✅ Soft-deleted instances properly excluded
- ✅ New instances created successfully
- ✅ UI updates immediately
- ✅ Data persists correctly

### ⚠️ Documentation Issues Identified

#### Issue #1: Timing Delay Inconsistency

**Severity:** Low
**Type:** Documentation

**Description:**

- Testing guide references **300ms** delay
- Commit message (0d25641) mentions **300ms** delay
- Actual code uses **150ms** delay

**Recommendation:** Update all documentation to reflect the actual 150ms delay

#### Issue #2: Missing Debug Logs

**Severity:** Low
**Type:** Testing/Debugging

**Description:**
Testing guide references debug logs like `[ITP Debug] Assigning ITP` that don't exist in the codebase.

**Recommendation:** Either add the detailed debug logs or update the testing guide to match actual logging

## Verification of Recent Commits

### ✅ Commit b2b8687: ITP Deletion Persistence

**Status:** FULLY VERIFIED
**Result:** Working perfectly

**What was tested:**

- Immediate removal from UI
- Persistence after page refresh
- DELETE API returns 200
- Subsequent GET requests exclude deleted ITPs
- No-cache headers prevent stale data

**Conclusion:** Fix is working perfectly. No regression detected.

### ✅ Commit 0d25641: ITP Visibility After Assignment

**Status:** VERIFIED (with additional fix)
**Result:** Working with duplicate detection fix applied

**What was tested:**

- Assignment API properly called
- Modal behavior correct
- 150ms delay implemented
- Immediate visibility of newly assigned ITPs
- Refetch behavior after assignment

**Conclusion:** Fix is working correctly after applying the duplicate detection fix.

## Code Changes Made

### File: `/apps/web/src/app/api/itp/instances/assign/route.ts`

**Line 99:** Added soft-delete filter to duplicate detection query

```diff
  // Query 3: Check for existing assignments
  supabase
    .from('itp_instances')
    .select('template_id')
    .eq('lot_id', lotId)
    .in('template_id', templateIds)
+   .is('deleted_at', null),
```
