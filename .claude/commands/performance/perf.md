# Performance Helper

I'll help you with any performance issue! Just describe what's slow or what you want faster.

**Your request:** {{USER_INPUT}}

Let me analyze that and help you optimize it.

I'll:

1. 🔍 Understand what part of the app you're talking about
2. 📊 Check current performance metrics
3. 🎯 Find what's causing the slowness
4. ✨ Suggest or implement fixes
5. ✅ Verify the improvement

Let's get started!
