  "analysis": "Project has significant compliance issues requiring immediate attention. Major non-compliances identified in earthworks compaction (97.3% vs required 98%) and drainage cover depths (280mm vs required 300mm). Weather conditions are manageable but require monitoring. Council approval timelines present significant risk with average processing times of 259 days versus 40-day statutory target. Estimated total financial impact of $145,000 including remediation, penalties, and delay costs. Critical path will be affected with estimated 15-day delay. Immediate action required on drainage cover depths and earthworks compaction to avoid further delays and cost escalation.",
